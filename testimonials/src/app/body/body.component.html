      <p class="experience1">
        In my academics, I learnt only theoretical concepts of programming but
        ProGrad emphasized my coding knowledge by teaching me a different
        approach in solving all the coding problems. My mentor offered me
        excellent support by guiding us on each step to improve my progress.
